<H1 style="color:red">The Chicago Cubs are heading into the 2018 MLB season with huge goals of winning their second World Series in three years. Joe Maddon and team have gone through a bit of change this offseason, but they believe that they are a stronger team than they were last season.</h1>
<H2 style="color:green">After falling to the LA Dodgers in the NLCS, the Cubs entered the offseason knowing that changes were needed. Among those changes were the gaining of Brandon Morrow, Tyler Chatwood, and Yu Darvish. Unfortunately, the addition of Darvish meant saying goodbye to former CY Young winner Jake Arrieta, who ended up signing with the Philadelphia Phillies</h2>
<H3 style="color:yellow">While the Cubs are going to be one of the best teams in the National League, there are quite a few other contenders as well. Teams like the Washington Nationals, Los Angeles Dodgers, and even the Milwaukee Brewers and St. Louis Cardinals will try to give the Cubs trouble.</h3>
